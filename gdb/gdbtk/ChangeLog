	* generic/gdbtk-varobj.c (variable_value): When varobj_get_value
	fails, use error_last_message to return the error to tcl land.
	This allows us to display nice messages about why "0xdeadbeef" is
	not accessible!

	* library/Makefile (ITCL_SH): Renamed to "ITCLSH".
	(tclIndex): We no longer have an Itcl shell, so we must use
	"package require Itcl".

2002-01-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

	* generic/gdbtk-cmds.c (gdb_find_file_command): If the symtab
	doesn't have the filename's fullname, look it up with
	symtab_to_filename.

2002-01-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

2002-01-03  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@redhat.com>

	* library/session.tcl (SESSION_serialize_bps): Ignore
	breakpoints set on internal_error and info_command because
	these are set by .gdbinit and will be recreated by it.
	This is a bit of a hack and should be fixed properly
	someday.
	
	* library/debugwin.itb: Fix incorrect button names
	so they will be enabled/disabled properly.

	* library/srctextwin.itb: Set focus on srcwin only
