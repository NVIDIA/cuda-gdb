2000-08-08  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (LoadFromCache): Do not cache if cannot stat the file.
	This lead to problems trying to access a incomplete cache entry later.

2000-06-06  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@cygnus.com>

        * util.tcl (find_iwidgets_library): Add missing global declaration
        which caused a stack trace instead of the proper error message.

2000-05-04  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@cygnus.com>

	* regwin.itb (build_win, update): Safer test for editable.

2000-05-01  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@cygnus.com>

2000-05-01  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@cygnus.com>

	* regwin.itb (build_win): Adjust size of columns independently, force

2000-04-27  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	These changes allow Insight to handle the case where there are
	symbols for the source files, but the source files are not in the
	location pointed to by the symbol.
	
	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::setTabs): Make the "asm" type for
	the source display "S" not "", which is not very clear.
        (SrcTextWin::configWin): ditto.
	(SrcTextWin::FillAssembly): Handle all return values from
	LoadFromCache.
	* (SrcTextWin::LoadFile): Handle "couldn't find file" return from
	LoadFromCache.
	* (SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): If the source file could not be
	found, return -1 rather than choking.
	Also change "asm" type for source from "" to "S".
	* srctextwin.ith: Change the defaults for the "asm" type from ""
	to "S" for Source display.  This is just cosmetic, but clearer.
	
2000-04-13  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* console.itb (Console::_complete): Dequoted first argument to
	switch.  Window name is `$_twin', not `_twin'.

2000-04-03  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* util.tcl (find_iwidgets_library): Follow links in determining
	the location of the executable.

2000-03-30  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@totem.to.cygnus.com>

	* variables.tcl (edit): Remove call to close, which caused editing
	of variables to fail.
	Note: I don't know why we would need to do this here as it seems
	that the "delete entry" operation will do that.
	Perhaps this was to account to some old widget bug.
	But we cannot call close here because it calls UnEdit,
	which unsets some of the edit state.
        (open): Make sure to abort any ongoing edit.  This was causing problems
	when someone tried to expand an structure while editing its pointer.

2000-03-28  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::startup): Open the SrcWin, this does 
	two things, 1) Makes sure that there IS a SrcWin, and 2) brings
	the first such window to the foreground...

2000-03-28  Jim Blandy  <jimb@redhat.com>

	Handle the fact that there are holes in the register numbering.
	* regwin.itb (RegWin::init_reg_display_vars): Ask gdb_regnames to
 	provide the register numbers, too; don't just assume that the Nth
 	element is register N.

2000-03-27  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	instructions to recreate this window.
	(ManagedWin::shutdown): New Method - run through the active windows
	pickling them all.
	(ManagedWin::startup): Restore all the saved active windows.
	* managedwin.ith: Declare pickle, shutdown & startup.
	* tclIndex: regenerate.

2000-03-10  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.ith (get_target_list): Should be a proc, since
	it does nothing instance-specific.

	* util.tcl (keep_raised): For some reason raising a window, then
	deiconifying it is MUCH faster on "e" & WindowMaker under XFree.  
	Go figure.  Other WM's don't seem to care, so do it this way...
	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::reveal): Ditto...

2000-03-10  Elena Zannoni  <ezannoni@kwikemart.cygnus.com>

	* srcbar.tcl (do_attach): Just call gdbtk_attach_native.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_attach_native): Renamed from do_attach method
        and moved from srcbar.tcl.

	to better distinguish from the native version.
        (run_executable): Change gdbtk_attach_target call into
        gdbtk_attach_remote.

        * srctextwin.itb: Add keyboard accelerator for Attach command.

        * tclIndex: Rebuild.

2000-03-09  Elena Zannoni  <ezannoni@kwikemart.cygnus.com>

	From: James Ingham <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>: 
	* attachdlg.itb (build_win): Pack the dialog better, so that when
 	window is resized components are not hidden.

2000-03-02  Elena Zannoni  <ezannoni@kwikemart.cygnus.com>

        * attachdlg.itb: Give a name to the window.

2000-03-01  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* interface.tcl (_open_file): The window which had the focus could 
	get deleted by the vwait implicit in the tk_getOpenFile call.  So
	check and make sure it is still around before raising it...

        * srctextwin.ith (_highlightAsmLine): Define new method.
        * srctextwin.itb (_highlightAsmLine): New method.
        (FillAssembly, FillMixed): Use _highlightAsmLine to highlight
        the current assembly line.	

Fri Feb  4 23:19:03 2000  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@b1.cygnus.com>

	* gdb/gdbtcl2: Directory renamed to gdb/gdbtk/library.
	
2000-01-12  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@totem.to.cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.itb (init_target_db): Add the word "serial" to
	the Angel target to make the distinction clear from the UDP connection.

2000-01-05  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@totem.to.cygnus.com>

	From Dave Vogel (dave@lightsurf.com):
	* targetselection.itb (init_target_db, config_dialog): Add support
	for selecting a target running the Angel monitor (RDI protocol)
	over an UDP connection.
	* interface.tcl (set_target_name): Set hostname when target is RDI
	over UDP (see previous entry).

1999-12-15  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* variables.tcl: UnEdit any fields open to edit before colapsing
	a tree branch (it was generating a Tcl exception and stack dump).

1999-09-29  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* prefs.tcl (pref_read): Convert env(HOME) to a win32 path BEFORE
	handing it to file join, so we won't look for a network drive.

1999-09-23  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* toolbar.tcl (GDBToolBar): Typo.
	(new_menu): Changed this to allow menus to be altered as well as
	added.
	(menu_exists): New method.
	(clear_menu): New method.
	(_load_src_images): Moved here from srcbar.tcl.  Added Attach &
	Detach classes.  This is all still kind of ill-factored.
	(In instance data): Made menu data arrays rather than dynamically
	constructed variables.

	* srcwin.itb (SrcWin::set_execution_status): Let gdb print the PC, 
	since Tcl's conversion may not be wide enough.

	* srctextwin.ith: initialize the Cname variable.

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::location):
	(SrcTextWin::location): Change address compare to a string
 	compare.  These are always both hex in the same format, but on a
 	64 bit host the conversion would fail.
	(SrcTextWin::showBalloon): Catch all errors in the balloon help
 	but also report them to the debug window.
	(SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): Erase and reload dirty cached windows.

	* srcbar.tcl (create_run_menu): Add "Attach", "Detach" and "Kill"
	for native targets.

	(do_detach): Detach from a native target.
	(do_kill): Kill a native target.

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::toggle_enabled): Toggle the state of the

	doesn't contain valid memory.
	(MemWin::update_address): Set the state to normal if we have
	loaded valid memory.
	(MemWin::BadExpr): Set the state to disabled on error.
	(MemWin::incr_addr): Set the state to normal if a step succeeds.

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::open_dlg): New function.  Preferred
 	function when you know you are opening a dialog.
	(ManagedWin::_open): new function, contains the common bits of
	opening windows & dialogs.
	(ManagedWin::open): Use the _open function.
	(ManagedWin::_create): Don't use Icon windows with modal dialogs.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_cleanup): Set a shutting_down flag.
	(gdbtk_tcl_fputs): Restore the fputs hook.  This is trivial to do, 
	and ensures that no one will delete the hook behind our backs.
	(gdbtk_tcl_fputs_error): ditto.
	(_open_file): Make file parameter optional, and don't query if it
	is provided.
	(gdbtk_attached): New function.  Called from attach hook.
	(gdbtk_detached): New function.  Called from detach hook.

	* helpviewer.ith (HtmlViewer): Add the attach dialog to the list
	of topics.

	* srcbar.tcl (do_kill): Added the Kill menu item for killing the
	inferior on native targets.

1999-09-16  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): define the wrap preference for
	the console window.

	* console.itb (Console::_paste): Add the "delete selection"
	semantics so we can use this for all the Paste events.
	(Console::_delete): New method, centralize delete handling so we
	can protect against things like delete deleting a selection up in
	the history region of the window.
	(Console::_build_win): Change bindings to use _paste & _delete.
	(Console::_build_win): wrap if told to by the wrap parameter.

	* console.ith: Declare _delete.

1999-09-16  Stan Shebs  <shebs@andros.cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.itb (TargetSelection::init_target_db): Remove
 	references to D10V target, use only standard remote for D10V.

1999-09-15  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* console.itb (Console::_paste): Fix another "set foo [catch ...]"
	idiom.
	(Console::_build_win): Remove the extraneous posting of the
	<<Paste>> event in handling B2-Release.  Just call _paste.

1999-09-10  James Ingham <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>
        From Mumit Khan  <khan@xraylith.wisc.edu>

        * prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Add main_names preference.
        * interface.tcl (gdbtk_locate_main): New proc.
        (run_executable): Use.
        * srcwin.itb (SrcWin::_build_win): Use.
        (SrcWin::location): Likewise.
        (SrcWin::point_to_main): Likewise.

1999-08-27  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::FillAssembly): Use the new
	gdb_load_disassembly.  
	(SrcTextWin::FillMixed): Use the new gdb_load_disassembly.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_idle): Call gdbtk_restore_fputs at idle
	time.  This puts the gdbtk_fputs hook back in place, just in case
	an error left it pointing to null.

1999-08-11  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* kod.itb (KodWin::build_win): Don't use Tix.

	(set_hook): New method.
	(create_view_menu): Don't put kod onto menu.

	* kod.itb (KodWin::display_object): Don't put `Details' message in
	label; this messes up resize and doesn't really add anything.

	* images/kod.gif, images2/kod.gif: Removed.
	* toolbar.tcl (create_window_buttons): Removed kod button.
	(add_menu_command): Don't load kod image.

	* kod.itb: Renamed from kod.tcl.  Restructured to follow new itcl
	conventions.

	gdb_kod_name.
	(create_view_menu): Likewise.
	* interface.tcl (initialize_gdbtk): Don't mention gdb_kod_name.

	* targetselection.itb (TargetSelection::init_target_db): Added
	Cisco targets.  From Martin Hunt.

1999-08-10  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::constructor): Add the disassembly
	flavor hook.
	(SrcTextWin::disassembly_changed): New method, fix up all the
	windows when the disassembly flavor changes.
	(SrcTextWin::_mtime_changed): We were setting the filename:dirty
	to 1 regardless of the result of the mtime check...  Doh!
	(SrcTextWin::reconfig): The setTabs call was assuming ALL windows
	were source windows.
	(SrcTextWin::do_tag_popup): Remove the balloon when the breakpoint 
	popups are posted as well.
	(SrcTextWin::do_source_popup): Also handle the case where there is

	object goes away. 

	* regwin.itb (RegWin::constructor): Add the disassembly_flavor_hook.

	popup a menu...

1999-08-05  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::showBalloon): Fix ShowBalloon.  We
	can't use "info line" to tell us whether we should post a balloon
	over the current line, since gdb only considers the first line of
	a statement executible, not the continuation lines.  Instead, show 
	any line in the currently selected function.  Sigh...

1999-08-06  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* interface.tcl (gdb_set_hook): New hook.

1999-08-02  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

        not "gdb_clear_file".

1999-06-23  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::_mtime_changed): Catch the call to
	mtime.  This will fail when you are in assembly mode, and the file 
	is actually a function address.
	(SrcTextWin::motion): Catch the call to showBalloon.  There are
	various things that can go wrong here, and we certainly don't want 
	the user to hear about them.

1999-06-15  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_stop_idle_callback): Catch calls to
	remove hook, since it could already be gone if we got a signal.

	* srcwin.itb (busy): If there is no target and the
	debugger is native, we should also let the user know
	that his program is running.

1999-06-11  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display): Only call clear
	file if there is a file loaded in the source window.  This avoids
	some flashing at startup.

1999-06-10  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (do_source_popup): Clear the varBalloon tag
	before mapping a popup onto the screen.
	(showBalloon): The "-pc" option was removed from gdb_variable.
	Provide equivalent functionality, and display popups again.
	
	* interface.tcl (set_target): Don't call the target dialog
	if there gdb_target_cmd is empty and we are a native debugger.
	Don't set a default target -- force the gui to ask the first
	time!
	(run_executable): Set options after we have a target, not before.

	* watch.tcl (destructor): Don't call no_inferior -- the window's
	already been destroyed. Instead, run through our list of variables
	and delete them.

1999-06-10  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::clear_file): Don't try to set the
	text view back to the gdbtk_scratch_widget, this is very fragile. 
	(SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): initialize the mtime correctly when
	you add a window to the cache.
	(SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): don't add the ,asm,lib to the scratch 
	widget pane name.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display): Only run
	gdbtk_clear_file if the filename is not null.  This avoids source
	window flashing.

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::_mtime_changed): Set a dirty flag
	when the mtime has changed so that you can know to reload the
	source. 
	(SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): Look at the dirty flag, and reload
	from disk if it is set.

1999-06-10  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* watch.tcl (clear_file): New method.

	* srcwin.ith (clear_file): Add declaration.
	* srcwin.itb (constructor): Register gdb_clear_file hook.

	and mtimes.
	(ClearTags): Catch calls removing tags. Needed when
	loading new executables.
	(_mtime_changed): New method.

	if a file has changed since it was last used. If it has, load
	it into the cache.
	(LoadFile): Add parameter to inform whether a file's
	mtime has changed. Reload the cache if it has.
	(clear_file): New method.
	(_initialize_srctextwin): New method.
	(_clear_cache): New method. Stubbed.
	* main.tcl: Move initialization of state to initialize_gdbtk in
	interface.tcl
	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display): Don't reset source
	windows or globals here -- the clear file hook will do that.
	(set_exe_name): Always say the exe has changed, in case
	the user reloads the same exe (which he's recompiled).
	(set_exe): Don't call gdb_clear_file.
	(set_target): Return string result codes.
	(clear_file_hook): New hook.
	(gdbtk_clear_file): New proc.
	(initialize_gdbtk): New proc. Moved initialization of
	globals (yich) here from main.tcl
	* download.itb (download_it): When running set_target,
	use new string return codes.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_attach_target): New proc. Moved
	contents of run_executable dealing with attaching to
	a target here.
	(run_executable): Use gdbtk_attach_target.
	(connect): Remove and merge with gdbtk_attach_target.
	* srcbar.tcl (do_connect): Use gdbtk_attach_target to
	attach to the target.

	* tclIndex: Regenerate.

1999-06-07  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* memwin.ith (numbytes): Change the default to 0, which means
	"depends on window size".  This is really the useful value.

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::newsize): Move getting the rheight to AFTER
	the update idletasks.  Otherwise the bbox call will return "" when
	the window is being constructed.
	(MemWin::reconfig): Set rheight back to "" to force it to be
	recomputed.  Both font changes and switch to "depends on window
	size" could invalidate this.

1999-06-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* srcwin.itb (set_execution_status): Do not try to second
	guess gdb_target_has_execution with gdb_running. Make
	gdb_running follow it. We'll have to fix those targets
	that do not set inferior_pid as they crawl out of the woodwork.

1999-06-07  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Set the initial height and with
	of the browser to 0 so the packer & gridder can get this right on
	systems with different fonts.  Fixes CR 100619.

	* browserwin.itb (BrowserWin::_build_win): Don't set the height
	and width of the file_box and func_box.  This keeps them from
	floating correctly when there is not stored default.

1999-06-04  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* regwin.itb (RegWin::acceptEdit): Call gdbtk_update after
	changing the register value so that the locals and watch window
	will get updated if any of these variables are in registers. Fixes
	CR 100670.

1999-05-25  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* variables.tcl (getLocals): Don't pass any args to 
	gdb_get_{locals, args} so that the currently selected frame is used.
	(context_switch): New method.
	* locals.tcl (getVariablesBlankPath): Don't catch call to getLocals.
	getLocals will do it and return {} if an error occurs.
	Always pass the frame of the variable to the variable backend,
	assuming that the selected frame is the proper frame to use.
	(update): Recognize context switches a little better.

	* variables.tcl (cursor): New method.
	(enable_ui): Use "cursor".
	(disable_ui): Ditto.
	(no_inferior): Ditto.
	(open): Change toplevel's cursor when opening variables.

1999-05-03  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* toolbar.tcl (create_help_menu): Open About window as transient.

	* main.tcl: Open About window as transient.

	* about.tcl (About): Set window title.

1999-04-27  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srcpref.itb (build_win): Pack the frame containing the
	disassembly flavor chooser.  Redid some of the other packing to
	look a bit nicer too.

	* srcpref.itb (save): Call apply and then close rather than
	duplicating the apply code.
	
1999-04-26  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* modal.tcl (ModalDialog): Add the "expire" variable, and cancel
	the dialog after the given time if set.

	* managedwin.ith (destructor): Use the new quit_if_last method to
	decide whether to quit the app or not.  This way you can manage
	create a splash screen and not quit the app when you take it down.
	(quit_if_last): Add default implementation - returns 1.

	* about.tcl (quit_if_last): Add the quit_if_last to the About box, 
	returning 0.

	* main.tcl: Added a line to open a splash screen, but commented it
	out for devo.

1999-04-22  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.itb (port_list): ManagedWin has a proc named
	"open". We really want the tcl command "::open" to open a port.

1999-04-15  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): New pref, gdb/use_icons.
	This is set if Unix should use gdbtk_icon.gif as an icon.  Some
	window managers, such as olvwm, have problems with it.
	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): Don't create icon
	for Unix, unless gdb/use_icons is set.
	* globalpref.itb (GlobalPref::build_win): Add a checkbutton to set
	pref gdb/use_icons.

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::window_name): If iconname is
	not specified, use window name.
	(ManagedWin::_create): For Unix, call make_icon_window.
	(ManagedWin::make_icon_window): New function.  Makes a unix
	icon.

	* main.tcl: Set initial target to "exec" if running in
	test mode.

	* bpwin.itb (BpWin::constructor): Set icon name to "BPs".
	* regwin.itb (BpWin::build_win): Set icon name to "Regs".
	* srcwin.itb (SrcWin::_update_title): Set icon name to basename 
	of filename.
	* variables.tcl (VariableWin::build_win): Set icon name to "Locals".

1999-04-12  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* variables.tcl (populate): Update the value of the parent variable's
	children before stuffing them into the window. This makes sure
	that the value of the variable is always current.

1999-04-09  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::incr_addr): Fix the increment-decrement
	control.  It would allow you to scroll into negative addresses,
	which causes some simulators to crash.  It would also increment
	improperly in cases where the address value in hex corresponded to 
	a negative signed int.

1999-04-07  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_signal): Don't set gdb_running to 0.

1999-04-06  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.itb (TargetSelection::getname): Call init_target_db.
	(TargetSelection::init_target_db): Add target mon2000. Set
	most remote targets to default to downloading. Add new
	baudrates for remote target. Other misc target fixes.
	(save) Use "pref setd" in case pref is not created yet.
	(TargetSelection::config_dialog): Gray out port number when
	in exec mode.

	* targetselection.ith: Add public proc init_target_db.
	
	* srcwin.itb (SrcWin::set_execution_status): Don't print anything
	if gdb_running is 0.

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::motion): Show variable values
	even when not debugging. Needed so users can examine values after
	a segfault.

	* interface.tcl (set_target): If the target name is "",
	use the default target name.
	(run_executable): Set gdb_running correctly. Don't
	allow downloading to "exec".
	(gdbtk_signal): New function called from gdbtk_annotate_signal.
	Sets gdb_running to 0 and pops up a dialog with the
	signal name and description.

	* main.tcl: Set initial target name to "". Set gdb_target_changed
	so a dialog will always be forced the first time.
	
	* download.itb (Download::download_it): Set gdb_loaded before
	notifying src windows the download is done. Catch the notifications
	in case the dialog has been closed.

	* console.itb (Console::destructor): Set gdbtk_state(console)
	to "" instead of unsetting it.

1999-04-02  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::build_win): Remove the -validate option from 
	the memory spinner.  It was not appropriate, since you can type
	expressions into the window.

1999-04-02  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* tclIndex: Rebuilt.
	* toolbar.tcl (create_control_buttons): Use SrcWin's
	inferior method to centralize control of inferior state.
	(create_control_buttons): Ditto.
	(source): Move SrcBar's public variable "source" here,
	so that the toolbar can use that info, too.
	* srcwin.itb (SrcWin::inferior): New public method
	to consildate inferior control and dispatch to proper
	handlers.
	* srcwin.ith (SrcWin::inferior): Add declaration.
	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::do_key): Use parent SrcWin's inferior
	method to handle inferior state changes (run, step, next, etc).
	* interface.tcl: Add procs to centralize inferior control:
 	gdbtk_step, gdbtk_next, gdbtk_stepi, gdbtk_nexti, gdbtk_run,
	gdbtk_continue, gdbtk_finish, gdbtk_stop.
	New stop button code (see comments before gdbtk_stop):
	(gdbtk_stop_idle_callback): Idle callback for stop button.
	(gdbtk_detach): New proc to forcibly detach from target.
	* main.tcl: Initialize data used by stop button.
	* srcbar.tcl (create_run_menu): Call SrcWin's inferior
	method with button commands.
	(source): Move "source" to Toolbar class.

1999-03-29  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* browserwin.itb (BrowserWin::do_all_bp): Fix quoting of break
	command.
	(BrowserWin::_toggle_bp): Ditto.

1999-03-19  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* download.itb (Download::download_it): Configure SrcWin's toolbar,
	too, to a downloading state.
	* srcbar.tcl (runstop): Change states from numbers to
	strings to avoid confusion.
	(_set_runstop): Change states from numbers to strings to
	avoid confusion.
	* srcwin.ith (toolbar): New public method.
	* srcwin.itb: Change all references of runstop to use new strings
	introduced into GDBSrcBar::_set_runstop.
	(SrcWin::toolbar): New public method to configure the state of the toolbar.
	* tclIndex: Regenerate.

1999-03-18  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* interface.tcl (set_target_name): Remove first argument.
	If prompt is not set, still update gdb_target_cmd.
	(set_target): Call set_target_name with prompt argument
	set correctly.
	(run_executable): Check for no exe name. Catch problems
	with bad target names and prompt for new one.

	* main.tcl: Set target name from prefs.  If it is "",
	the set "gdb_target_changed" to force it to be changed
	later.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Don't set target default
	to "exec".  Leave the default unset.
	
	* srcbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Update args to
	set_target_name.
	
1999-03-18  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* prefs.tcl (pref_read): Change unix preference filename
	to ".gdbtkinit". This bogosity has been around long enough.

1999-03-16  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): When running under
	testsuite, don't resize.

1999-03-13  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* browserwin.itb (BrowserWin::search): If all the files are
	selected in the file box, then don't pass the files argument.
	This makes the function browser a little quicker.  The main
	slowdown, however, is sorting the resultant list.  Maybe do this
	in C to get this quicker?

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::edit): Comment out the line that reads back
	in the newly set memory value.  Because of the chain of calls,
	on Windows this causes some evil race that results in GDBTk
	filling all the visible cells with the new value.  I don't
	understand it yet, so this is just a temporary fix.

1999-03-12  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* memwin.ith (MemWin): Add saved_addr to the class.  This is where 
	we store the old address before we change addresses, so that we
	can get back to a good state in case of errors.

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::update_addr): gdb_get_mem does not always
	return an error code when it hits an error.  Catch that here.
	(MemWin::update_address): Store away the old address, so we can
	restore it if there is an error.
	(MemWin::BadExpr): Restore the saved address in case of errors.
	

1999-03-09  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* Rebuilt tclIndex.

1999-03-08  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::constructor): pc(funcname) was
	changed to pc(func), but the initialization was not changed...

	* download.ith (dont_remember_size): Download window should not
	remember its size.

	* interface.tcl (connect): Handle the case where set_target
	returns 3...

	* debugwin.itb (DebugWinDOpts::build_win): Replace $this delete
	with delete object $this.
	* tfind_args.tcl (build_win): Ditto...
	* helpviewer.itb (HtmlViewer::_buildwin): Ditto...	

	* srcbar.tcl (GDBSrcBar): Reorder the Source & the page setup &
	print menus...

1999-03-04  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* download.ith: New file.
	* download.itb: New file.  Implements itcl3 class and replaces
	download.tcl.
	
	* srcbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Call create_run_menu
	without arguments.
	(create_run_menu): Add Disconnect and Connect to Run menu
	instead of file menu. Change download_it to Download::download_it.

	* srctextwin.itb (do_key): Change binding to call 
	Download::download_it.
	
	* debugwin.itb (DebugWinDOpts::build_win): Add ProcessWIn to list
	of classes for filter.

	* interface.tcl (set_target): No need to set window title.
	(run_executable): Change download_it to Download::download_it

1999-03-04  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* modal.tcl (ModalDialog): Handle WM_DELETE_WINDOW by calling the
	cancel method.  Also set unpost_notification to different values
	in unpost & the destructor, so if the object dies irregularly, you 
	know not to try to double destruct it.

1999-03-03  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* warning.tcl (WarningDlg::constructor):Destroy with unpost.

	* util.tcl (get_disassembly_flavor, set_disassembly_flavor,
 	init_disassembly_flavor): Added these functions for the Intel P2
 	disassembly flavors.
	(list_element_strcmp): New function for lsort -command on lists.

	* tracedlg.tcl (TraceDlg): Change combobox callback to reflect new 
	after behavior.

	* targetselction.itb (TargetSelection::save): If the target
	is not valid, tell the user rather than simple refusing to go
	away.
 	Also move stuff around to isolate the instance dependant stuff as
	much as possible
	Also replace delete with unpost.

	* targetselection.ith (TargetSelection): Make as much of the
	initialization stuff Class functions as possible.  Then only
	initialize it once.

	* srcwin.ith (_update_title): initialize need_files.

	* srcwin.itb (SrcWin::_build_win): I changed the combobox so it
	ran its code in an idle handler, so we can take out all the after
	idle... cruft here.

	* srctextwin.ith (SrcTextWin): Added textheight variable so you
	can adjust the height of the text display.

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::build_win): Don't hardcode the size
	of the text window, set it with the textheight option instead.  
	Also replace childsite with "component text" wherever required.

	* srcpref.itb (SrcPref::build_win, set_flavor): Added the Intel
 	disassembly flavor combobox.  Added set_flavor method to support
	this.
	* srcpref.ith: Added declaration for set_flavor, and
	disassembly_flavor instance variable.

	* modal.tcl (ModalDialog::post, unpost): Added unpost method to
	provide a more regular way to dismiss the dialogs.  Just
	destroying them was leading to funny destruction order bugs.
	Added cancel method, which is what client code should call to
	"force close" the dialog, so child classes can override, and do
	some cleanup.

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::destructor): Call the cancel method of the
	Preferences dialog (if it is posted) rather than just destroying
	it.

	* mempref.itb (MemPref::ok): call unpost, since this is a modal
	dialog.

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::reveal): Used to be called raise.
	Don't reuse Tcl or Tk commands unless there is a really good
	reason to...
	(ManagedWin::destroy_toplevel): renamed from delete, which
	conflicts both with the Itcl1.5 delete method, and the Itcl3.0
	delete command...  Also, don't use this as the way to destroy
	ManagedWins, rather destroy the object and let the object take
	care of removing its toplevel.
	(ManagedWin::_create): Group all the windows with 
	. for WindowManagers that properly handle this.
	(ManagedWin::_create): Use dont_remember_size
	rather than the instance variable.  Also, windows which don't
	remember size are not necessarily transient.
	(ManagedWin::_create): Only call post if the
	ManagedWin also isa ModalDialog.  It is clearer what is going on.
	* managedwin.ith: Carry through the name changes.
	
	* main.tcl: call init_disassembly_flavor for Intel assembly
	flavors.

	*main.tcl: Group . with .  This is half of the work required to
	play nice with WindowMaker.  The other half waits till we can get
	gdb to pass the command-line arguments to Tcl.

	* interface.tcl: Add file_changed_hook to the hooks.  The browser
	window watches this and refreshes the file box if it changes.

	* globalpref.ith (GlobalPref): This should be a modal dialog.
	* globalpref.itb (GlobalPref::build_win): call update idletasks,
	not update.  Since we are calling update, there is no reason to
	delay calling resize_font_item_height.
	* globalpref.itb: Replace destroy toplevel with unpost.

	* debugwin.itb (DebugWin::build_win): Replace childsite with
	"component text"

	* console.itb (Console::_build_win): Replace childsite with
	"component text"

	* browserwin.itb: Rewritten pretty completely.
	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): add the browser preferences.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): add the intel disassembly flavor
	preference.

	* about.tcl (About): This should be a modal dialog.

1999-03-02  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* globalpref.itb (GlobalPref::make_font_item): Don't do the
 	resize_font_item_height here, since an update can cause the resize
 	before all the windows are built.  Delay to the end of build_win
 	instead.

1999-02-24  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* toolbar.tcl (remove_button): Specify the row in the toolbar from 
	which you are removing the item.  On Windows, there are two rows
	in the standard toolbar...

1999-02-22  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* warning.tcl (WarningDlg::constructor): Remove extra quote
	that was causing loading of this module to fail.

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): If the pack fails
	(for example because the warning dialog reliazed it should
	ignore the warning) print a warning debug message and return.
	Also, while testing, tell the window manager to position
	the window without asking the user for the position.

1999-02-18  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::FillAssembly): As a last resort, 
	if the disassembly fails for some reason, switch to the scratch
	pane and write in a message about not being able to disassemble.

1999-02-18  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	
	* helpviewer.ith (HtmlViewer): Add thread and function
	browser windows to help index.

	* help/index.toc: Removed.

	* help/source.html: Add index for thread_bp.
	
1999-02-17  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* globalpref.itb (GlobalPref::build_win): Add a checkbutton to 
	allow use of an internet browser to read help files.
	
	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Add preference gdb/help/browser.
	Default is to use builtin html help.

	* helpviewer.itb (HtmlViewer::open_help): New public proc.
	Depending on preferences, opens help in external browser or
	internal htmlviewer.

	* toolbar.tcl (create_help_menu): Use HtmlViewer::open_help.

1999-02-17  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	
	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): Restore some lines that
	were accidently checked in commented out.

	* help/browser.html: New help file.

1999-02-12  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): If a window class defines a
	public variable "nosize" the size will not be set, only the position.
	* browserwin.ith (toggle_all_bp): Add public variable "nosize".	

1999-02-12  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	should not take an argument.
	(set_target_name): Ditto.
	* srcbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Ditto.
	* memwin.itb (MemWin::create_prefs): Ditto.
	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): Ditto.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Ditto.
	
1999-02-09  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* managedwin.itb (ManagedWin::_create): Simplify raise
	and post now that all windows use new manager.

	* warning.tcl (WarningDlg): Rewrite of entire class to use
	new itcl 3.0 class. Also now uses a "class name" to keep
	track of which messages should be ignored. Uses tk_messageBox
	of the message doesn't have -ignorable set.

	* interface.tcl: Removed IDE stuff.
	(gdbtk_tcl_ignorable_warning): Accept "class" argument and

	* srctextwin.itb (build_win): Set the paned window background to
	white so it looks better when you switch windows.

	match on history buffer in the reverse direction.
	(Console::_build_win): Bind Control-Up, Control-Down,
	Shift-Up, and Shift-Down to search history instead of mess
	up the console window. Bind Control-o to break to disable it.

	Fix problems with error dialogs.

1999-02-02  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::do_source_popup): Even after fixing the
	obvious syntax errors in this function, it didn't work. So I
	simplified the logic. Now it will attempt to use whatever is selected.
	If multiple lines are selected and tracing is enabled, it will set
	tracepoints, otherwise it will try to extract a variable name from single
	lines only.

	* main.tcl: Only open debugwin if GDBTK_DEBUG > 1.

	* toolbar.tcl (create_view_menu): Only add "Debug WIndow" menu
	item if GDBTK_DEBUG is set.

        the "lib" arg.

        * srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): Add "lib"
        argument. This is used to create a unique cache key so
        we don't confuse the disassembly of a function in a shared
        lib with the disassembly of its trampoline. Also updated 
        UnLoadFromCache, LoadFIle, FillSource, FillMixed, and FillAssembly
        to pass this argument around.

        * helpviewer.ith (HtmlViewer::constructor): Declare we have a 
        constructor.
        (PageStack::constructor): Delete this declaration.

Tue Dec 15 11:07:01 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>
 
        * process.tcl (build_win): Do not export the listbox's selection
        as the X selection so that multiple listboxes can have selections
        highlighted at the same time.
 
        * stack.tcl (build_win): Ditto.
 
Mon Dec 14 15:53:38 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        from gdb_cmd to the underlying commands.  Pass 1 when the
	command is invoked from the console.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_tstart, gdbtk_tcl_tstop): Run the
	src window's do_tstop method rather than manipulating the 
	widgets by hand.

	* src.tcl (build_win): Redo the packing so that the function
	combobox doesn't push all the other combo-boxes off the screen
	if it has a very long function name in it.

	* srcbar.tcl (do_tstop): Added a mode that just changes the
	GUI, which can be called from console hooks.

	* srctextwin.tcl: Fixed some bugs I introduced in setting
	breakpoints in the assembly & mixed mode windows.  Dropped
	the notion of joint breakpoint images for lines that have 
	breakpoints of two separate types.  Too fragile.
        Also added the "dont_change_appearance" flag, used in the
	continue_to_here method to tell the GUI not to reflect the
	temporary disabling of all the breakpoints.
	
	* toolbar.tcl (insert_buttons): Added a little more error-checking.

Wed Nov 11 08:40:04 1998  Fernando Nasser  <fnasser@cygnus.com>

 	create_view_menu): ibid
	* tclIndex: regen

Mon Nov  9 12:09:48 1998  Michael Snyder  <msnyder@cleaver.cygnus.com>

	* actiondlg.tcl: Customize the stack collect string to collect
        the FP reg plus 64 words of stack mem.  This will work for many
        targets.  As noted in earlier comment, we need a way to configure
        this to the specific target.

Wed Nov  4 12:41:42 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* actiondlg.tcl: Get the stack collect string from an instance 
	variable.  Need to implement some way to get this from the
	target settings...
	* global_pref.tcl (toggle_tracing_mode): Add & remove hooks
	when you go in and out of tracing mode.  Also reset the B1
	behavior when you leave tracing mode
	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_trace_find_hook): Added the trace
	find hook, so you can switch the GUI state when the tfind
	command is used to enter & leave browse mode.
	* srcbar.tcl (constructor, destructor trace_find_hook): Added
	the trace_find_hook to the source toolbar, and added the
	necessary hooks to handle it.
	* srctextwin.tcl (trace_find_hook): Added a trace find hook to 
	the sourcebar as well.
	* stack.tcl (update): protect against errors in gdb_stack.
	Just return "NO STACK" if we couldn't get it.
	* src_pref.tcl (constructor, cancel): Put all the saved prefs
	in an array, on cancel, see if any have changed and only
	rebuild the window if there have been changes.

1998-11-03  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* target.tcl: Add ice target.
	(GdbLoadPref): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(set_saved): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(write_saved): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(change_target): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(build_win): Add "after_attaching" entry to options
	frame.

	* main.tcl (set_target_name): Add ice target.
	(set_target): If an "after_attaching" preference exists,
	run it.
	
Mon Nov  2 13:24:10 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* bp.tcl (update): The hook function was passing more
	arguments than this function expected.

Mon Nov  2 11:16:10 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* toolbar.tcl: Added Tdump image.	

Fri Oct 30 17:36:05 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (set_execution_status): Changed status messages,
	tracing is not the same as async debugging...

Fri Oct 30 17:06:31 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* bp.tcl (bp_all): Only remove tracepoints in the tracepoint
	window, and breakpoints in the breakpoint window.
	
Fri Oct 30 11:22:23 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* actiondlg.tcl: Added special tag "Collect Stack".  This
	still needs to get hooked into the target database to deal
	with targets that need to do something special to collect the
	stack.  Also moved some repeated code into loops.
	* main.tcl (source_file): Source in a file of gdb commands.
	* srcbar.tcl (constructor): Added source file menu entry, and
	made stack buttons belong to both the Trace & Control classes.
	* srctextwin.tcl (constructor): One too many separators in the 
	trace trace popup menu.
	* tclIndex: regenerated.
	* tfind_args.tcl: Added "tfind frame"
	* toolbar.tcl (create_button): Allow a button to belong to
	more than one class.

Tue Oct 27 13:46:03 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* Many little bug fixes all over in order to get tracing to work 
        along with normal program control.
	* toolbar.tcl: Rewrote much of the code here to put commonly
	used code into functions, and clean up adding menus and
	buttons.  Added the ability to disable particular menu items,
	not just whole menus.  Added the ability to delete and insert
	buttons on the fly.
	* srcbar.tcl: Pushed the changes to toolbar.tcl into this file.
	* srctextwin.tcl: Changed the code dealing with breakpoints
	and tracepoints to use the text tags more consistently.  Use
	only one set of menus for the whole widget, rather than having
	a separate set for the SRC+ASM case.  Rewrote a lot of the
	code to separate out the tracing & program control functions.
	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_breakpoint): pass more information
	to the scrtextwin when a breakpoint changes state, so it can
	do the right thing without having to guess...
	* tracedlg.tcl (build_win): get the packing right so the
	window expands correctly.
	* main.tcl: do_tstop -> tstop,  do_tstart -> tstart to avoid
	confusion with the methods in ScrBar.tcl.
	* prefs.tcl: Added two new preferences B1_Behavior to control
	whether B1 sets breakpoints or tracepoints.
	* src_prefs.tcl: Put in support for the B1_Behavior.
        * global_prefs.tcl: Put back tracing checkbox.
        * tdump.tcl: Fixed an incorrect (1 rather than 1.0) text
	widget line specification.
	* tfind_args.tcl (build_win): Bind return in the entry to the
	OK button.  Clear the entry field if the Type has changed. 
	* utils.tcl: Added comments for the debug commands.
	* watch.tcl (build_win): Flash the OK button before invoking it.

Wed Oct 28 16:19:57 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl: Changed the _map cache to use
        the variable Cname instead of the kludgy upvar alias.

Mon Oct 26 21:08:54 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (motion): Show breakpoint balloons
	even when not running.
	(showBPBalloon): Check for null before displaying.

Wed Oct 21 10:05:17 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* images/kod.gif: Added temporary kernel object display icon.

Wed Oct 14 17:30:07 PDT 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_preloop): Fixed the code to set gdb_exe_name.
	I seem to have dropped a variable...
	* main.tcl (_open_file): Make the open file dialog truely
	modal on windows.

Wed Oct 14 14:29:17 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* target.tcl: Change default runlist for remote
	targets to download.
	(build_win): Add user-defined list of functions for
	initial breakpoints.
     
	* main.tcl (run_executable): Set user-defined initial
	breakpoints.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Define new prefs 
	gdb/load/bp_at_func and gdb/load/bp_func. These are
	user-defined initial breakpoints.
	
Sat Oct 10 00:21:44 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* help/source.html: Add new images, add description of changes
	to breakpoints and threads support.  Fix typos.

	* help/memory.html: Cleanup and add new information.

	* help/breakpoint.html: Reformat.
	
	* help/images: Add a bunch of new GIFs.

1998-10-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (run_executable): Do not call set_exe here, either.
        (_open_file): Add some comments about using set_exe
        here instead of in download_it and run_executable. Do not look
        for main, either, since the file hooks will take care of that.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_pre_add_symbol): Do not reset the
        source windows here -- only show the user what is going on.
        (gdbtk_tcl_post_add_symbol): Force the source windows' file
        comboboxes to refill, since adding a symbol file may actually
        expand the debugger's view of the world.
        (gdbtk_tcl_file_changed): New hook proc. Called by file_changed_hook
        in symfile.c, this hook will cause the source window to point
        to main/entry. gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display actually sets up
        gdbtk for this.
        (gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display): Renamed from
        gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_changed for clarity. This hook is called
        from exec_file_display_hook in exec_file_command. This function
        sets up gdbtk to use a new executable, including resetting the
        debugger's state and source window(s). See comments in this file
        for more information.

	* download.tcl (download_it): Don't call set_exe here and
        do not touch state variables gdb_target_changed -- run_executable
        will do it. (In short, make download_it one step closer to only
        doing the download!)

1998-10-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* variables.tcl (UnEdit): Fix quoting problems so that arrays may be
        inspected/edited.
        (edit): Ditto.

Wed Oct  7 16:03:00 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* manage.tcl (manage_create): Bind ALL source windows
	Map and Unmap events.
	(manage_delete): Small optimization.
	(manage_iconify): When the last source window is iconified,
	iconify all the support windows too.  When any source
	window is deiconified, deiconify everything.

	* src.tcl (destructor): Destroy SrcTextWin too. 

Tue Oct  6 23:00:08 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (set_status): Display only the first line of
	the message.
	(build_win): Configure status window to a height of 1.

	* srcbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Change "Open..."
	menu item to call _open_file proc. Remove old
	_open_file method.

	* main.tcl (run_executable): If the run command fails
	with a result of "No executable" then call _open_file.
	(_open_file): New proc. Opens a file requester and 
	sets the executable name to the selected file.

	* toolbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Add "..." to Source
	and Global prefs menu item.

Mon Oct  5 21:10:30 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (set_tracepoint):  The filename variable 
	changed to current(filename) but this use was not updated.

	* global_prefs: Added a global preference to turn on the 
	tracing.  It only sets the tracing preference, and does
	not cause gdb to relayout the toolbar yet...

	* util.tcl: Fixed the comments for the little debug
	thingie.

	* util.tcl (auto_step): Added a way to cancel the
	auto_stepping.  This is not currently used, but with this
	it could be...

Mon Oct  5 00:43:11 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (SrcTextWin): Create a threaded image
	with a color of [pref get gdb/src/thread_fg].
	(bind_src_tags): Bind bp_tag <Motion> and <Leave> for
	balloon help on breakpoints.
	(config_win): A bunch of binding changes to support
	balloon help breakpoints and setting multiple BPs
	on a line. Add menu item for thread specific BPs.
	(reconfig): Similar changes as above.
	(register_balloon): Remove.
	(updateBalloon): Cleanup and don't call register_balloon.
	(do_bp): When a BP is deleted, call gdb_find_bp_at_line()
	to see if there are any more BPs at the same line number.
	Add "thread" BP type.
	(bp_line): Accept an optional list of thread numbers to 
	set BPs on. Loop through the list setting BPs on each thread.
	(motion): Accept a window and type argument. Call 
	showBPBalloon in type is not "var".
	(showBPBalloon): New method.Opens a balloon with breakpoint
	info in it.
	(showballoon): Accept window parameter.
	(ask_thread_bp): New. A thread selector dialog. Opens
	a scrolled listbox with a list of threads and allows
	the user to multiselect threads to set BPs on.
	(do_thread_bp): New callback from ask_thread_bp()
	listbox.

	* src_pref.tcl: Replace disabled color selector with thread
	fg selector.  Disabled color should probably always be
	black anyways.

	* util.tcl (CygScrolledListbox): Temporary simple scrolled
	listbox. Replace with a better one soon.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Set default for thread fg.

	* bp.tcl (bp_add): For thread BPs, set the button color
	correctly.

	* tclIndex: Rebuilt.

Fri Oct  2 17:07:32 1998   Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* util.tcl (debug namespace): Added helper functions
	"trace_var", "remove_trace" & "remove_all_traces" which
	watch a variable, and dump the stack, and its value when
	it is touched...  They are in the "debug" namespace.
	*tclIndex: regenerate index.

Fri Oct  2 14:02:25 1998   Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_preloop): Catch the error when no file
	is given on the command line.

1998-10-02  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* srcbar.tcl (_open_file): Call SrcWin::point_to_main.
	(_set_runstop): Catch the stop in case the user
	aborts a session.

	* srctextwin.tcl (destructor): New. Remove all previously added
	hooks.
	
	* src.tcl (point_to_main): New function. I got tired of typing
	the same five lines over and over again.

	* main.tcl (set_baud): Target baud preferences are stored as 
	[target name]-baud, not [target name]/baud.
	(run_executable): Call SrcWin::point_to_main.
	(gdbtk_tcl_preloop): Call SrcWin::point_to_main.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_pre_add_symbol): Use "update idletasks", not
	just "update".
	(gdbtk_tcl_post_add_symbol): Rewrite to have better behavior
	for symbol files which have been loaded. Use a small hack to work
	with gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_changed so that we look for main only
	when a new executable is loaded.
	(gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_changed): New proc to do some necessary
	setup when an exec file changes.

	* tclIndex: Regenerate.

Fri Oct  2 11:40:05 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	aborts a session.

Thu Oct  1 18:58:11 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_preloop): We were using lindex on the
	return value from info files, but if the directory had a space
	in it, then the result was not a proper Tcl list, and so the
	command would fail.  Use regexp instead...	

Thu Oct  1 17:21:26 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* download.tcl (download_it): One more place where we used
	"Foundry_Debugger" unconditionally...  Stamped out.

Wed Sep 30 21:32:39 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (insertBreakTag): There was a bug in the
        method of inserting break tags.  If a tag of the intended
        type did not already exist, insertBreakTag would not set it.
	This method is a little less flexible, but actually works 
	for all our uses.

Wed Sep 30 19:42:43 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (set_execution_status): When the program has
        terminated, most stubs detach.  Then we need to set 
        gdb_target_changed here so gdb will know to reattack when
        you press the Run button.

	* memory.tcl (update_address): We caught the gdb_eval when you 
	give an address expression, but then only trapped the case
	where you gave an invalid address or non-existant symbol.
	Trap all the other errors as well...

1998-09-28  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* download.tcl (download_it): Don't download if there is no executable...

Mon Sep 28 14:23:39 1998   Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* modal.tcl: NEW FILE.  Had to fix a bug in the dialogs
        so I made a sub-class: ModalDialog.  The bug was that
	manage.tcl sets the WM_DELETE_WINDOW handler to be
	"manage delete" of the window, which is wrong for these
	windows, they need to unpost themselves first.  Override
	this in the post method.
	* mem_pref.tcl: Subclass & remove the code that went into
	the ModalDialog class.
	* target.tcl: ditto.
        * tclIndex: regenerate for the new class.

Fri Sep 25 19:01:32 1998   Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* utils.tcl (freeze): Hacked the freeze method so that it comes closer
        to working on Windows, but it still flashes.  Use a post
	method, like that im mem_prefs.tcl or target.tcl instead.
        * mem_pref.tcl (post): Added post method, so you can use the
	Windows EnableWindow call without sending your app into the
	background when the dialog is dismissed.
        * target.tcl (post): Added the same method to this class.
	Really should subclass these.  Will do this when we rework the 
	class hierarchy for Itcl3.0.
	* memory.tcl (create_prefs): Use the new post method. 
	* main.tcl (set_target_name): Use the post method rather than
	freeze.

	the idle function.

	stuff.

	stuff.  Clear any breakpoints at exit and main before
	restarting.  They get set again automatically if the

	(update): Renamed to update_download to avoid confusion.

        Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	* src.tcl (build_win): Set mode combobox width to 10.
	(goto_func): If a function name is an unmangled one,
	it is a C++ method so don't prepend filename when
	setting location.  This is a kludge, but we are limited
	by the symtax the GDB command line parser will accept.
	(location): When loading function combobox,
	remember which names are unmangled. Change width of
	function combobox dynamically to better accomodate
	those long C++ names.

        Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	* src.tcl (bp_line): When doing a "continue to here",

        Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@cygnus.com>

	with the parameter indicating whether to delete breakpoints.
	If GDB is loaded ($gdb_loaded == 1) and the app is running
	($gdb_app_running == 1) then we don't delete the breakpoints.
	All other situations will require deleting the breakpoints.
	This allows us to redownload and run the same executable w/o
	losing the breakpoint information.
	* download.tcl: (download_it): Modified this routine to
	take a boolean parameter indicating whether to delete
	the breakpoints before downloading.

        Sean Mahan  <smahan@cygnus.com>

	in parsing the stack line to get the correct PC.

        Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>
	* download.tcl (download_it): Run gdb_busy_hook's.
	If anything fails, make sure that the no_inferior_hook's are run.
	Note errors that occur during downloading, ignoring the
	"cancelled download" message. If an error occurs, set the
	global gdb_download_error to the error message so that it can
	be shown to the user later. Don't run the idle hooks if nothing
	* src.tcl (download_progress): Do not rely on the value of
	"download_cancel_ok" -- it is cleared in download_it.
	Reorder code to take advantage of gdb_loaded and gdb_download_error
	to determine if a download was canceled, successful, or failed due
	to an error. Truncate the "DOWNLOAD FINISHED:" message so that it
	will fit into the status bar given the recent font changes.
	(busy): If gdb_loaded, set the status bar to read "Program is running."
	Otherwise, don't touch it.
	(config_win): Comment out "Continue to here" right-click menu item
	until it can properly preserve breakpoint state.
	(no_inferior): Configure the toolbar to -runstop 0. All of these
	toolbar references should be done via the busy hook by the SrcBar
	class itself someday...

	to map full pathnames with short names that are easily displayed.
	(file): Call set_name to update name combobox.
	(location): Call set_name to update name combobox. When setting
	the function combobox, adjust height to a maximum of 10. CLear
	filename combobox if there is no valid filename. When setting the
	filename combobox, adjust height to a maximum of 10. Create
	_files array mapping full pathnames to short names. For IDE, use
	vmake/source-files and project-root to build full pathnames.
	When changing mode, save current line. Don't mark current line
	with PC_TAG if gdb_running is 0.
	(set_name): New function. Update the name combobox, using
	the short name from _files if available.
	* bp.tcl (bp_modify, bp_add): Use short file name from
